    <title>Incompatible changes from 2.0 to 2.2</title>
    <para>See also the PORTING document in the toplevel GMime source directory.</para>
    <para>There are no incompatible changes between 2.0 and 2.2.</para>
    <para>GMime 2.2 is both API and ABI compatible with GMime 2.0 meaning
that any program written for GMime 2.0 will compile fine with GMime
2.2 and any program linked against GMime 2.0's libraries will also
work with GMime 2.2's libraries.</para>
    <para>Most of the changes made between 2.0 and 2.2 were internal but there
are a few API changes you should be aware of (as these interfaces will
be deprecated in some future version, probably 3.0).</para>

        <para>
<function>g_mime_utils_8bit_header_decode()</function> has been split
into 2 functions. We now have
<function>g_mime_utils_header_decode_text()</function> and
<function>g_mime_utils_header_decode_phrase()</function>.
<function>g_mime_utils_header_decode_text()</function> no longer
requires encoded-words to be rfc822 atoms. 
<function>g_mime_utils_header_decode_phrase()</function> is
still strict in that encoded-words MUST be valid rfc822 atoms.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
<function>g_mime_utils_8bit_header_encode()</function> has been
renamed to <function>g_mime_utils_header_encode_text()</function> to
be more clear as to what type of header this is supposed to encode. If
you haven't guessed, this function is for encoding rfc822 'text'
headers (such as Subject).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
<function>g_mime_utils_8bit_header_encode_phrase()</function> has been
renamed to <function>g_mime_utils_header_encode_phrase()</function>
mostly for consistency with the previous 2 changes.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
<function>g_mime_charset_name()</function> has been renamed to
<function>g_mime_charset_iconv_name()</function> for clarity.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
<function>g_mime_charset_locale_name()</function> has been renamed to
<function>g_mime_locale_charset()</function>.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
<function>g_mime_cipher_context_verify()</function> no longer returns
a <structname>GMimeCipherValidity</structname>, instead it returns a
<structname>GMimeSignatureValidity</structname> which is far more
useful. Never fear, you may still use the
<structname>GMimeCipherValidity</structname> APIs for the time being -
they work fine given a <structname>GMimeSignatureValidity</structname>
structure.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
<function>g_mime_multipart_signed_verify()</function> also now returns
a <structname>GMimeSignatureValidity</structname> structure rather than
a <structname>GMimeCipherValidity</structname> structure. See changes to
<function>g_mime_cipher_context_verify()</function> for details.</para>
