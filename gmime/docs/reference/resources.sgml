    <title>Filing a bug report or feature request</title>
    <para>
If you encounter a bug, misfeature, or missing feature in GMime, please
file a bug report at 
<ulink url="https://github.com/jstedfast/gmime/issues">https://github.com/jstedfast/gmime/issues</ulink>. 
We'd also appreciate reports of incomplete or misleading information in 
the GMime documentation.
</para>
    <para>
The issue tracker should also be used for feature requests, it's not only for bugs.
We track all GMime development in GitHub's issue tracker, so it's the way to be sure
that the GMime developers won't forget about an issue.

    <title>Submitting Patches</title>
    <para>
If you develop a bugfix or enhancement for GMime, please submit a pull request
if you can. Sending the patch (as generated by a <command>diff -u</command>) to
the mailing-list also works (although a pull request is preferred). Note that
all patches must be offered under the terms of the
<ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.txt">LGPLv2.1</ulink>
license, so be sure you are authorized to give us the patch under
those terms.
</para>
    <para>
If you want to discuss your patch before or after developing it, mail
<ulink url="mailto:gmime-devel-list@gnome.org">gmime-devel-list@gnome.org</ulink>.

    <title>Mailing lists</title>
    <para>There is currently only one mailing-list devoted to GMime
    itself which is for both the development of and development with
    GMime. You can subscribe to this list
    at <ulink url="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gmime-devel-list">http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gmime-devel-list</ulink>.
