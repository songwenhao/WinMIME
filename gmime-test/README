                               GMime Examples
                   by Jeffrey Stedfast <fejj@gnome.org>


Example: basic-example.c
------------------------

This example code illustrates a good number of the common tasks an
application developer using GMime is likely to use, including parsing
messages, verifying pgp signatures, adding/removing MIME parts and
writing messages back out again.


Example: imap-example.c
-----------------------

Although the name implies that this example source contains t0p
s3kret imap hackery action, in reality, it doesn't. The focus of this
example is more how to split out MIME parts into separate files and
then to restore them back into the original MIME structure using a
technique similar to (but not exactly) IMAP's BODYSTRUCTURE and
single-part FETCHing.

I think you'll find this example is worth looking at if you plan on
using GMime with your IMAP library.


Example: uuencode.c
-------------------

This program illustrates how to use the low-level MIME encoding
routines (specifically the uuencode and base64 encoding
routines). You'll likely find that this program outperforms GNU's
implementation of uuencode.


Example: uudecode.c
-------------------

This program illustrates how to use the low-level MIME decoding
routines (specifically the uudecode and base64 decoding
routines). You'll likely find that this program outperforms GNU's
implementation of uudecode.


Don't forget to take a look at any test programs that came bundled
with this distribution (they will be in tests/), as they will also
provide you with samples that you may find useful.
